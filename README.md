## Overview

The Stellar Classification Project aims to develop a machine learning model to classify stars into various spectral classes. This classification is based on features extracted from the stellar spectra. The project utilizes a Jupyter Notebook for data processing, model training, and evaluation.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains information about stars, including their spectral features and corresponding classes. It is sourced from astronomical surveys and databases. The key attributes include:

- Redshift
- Ultraviolet filter
- Green filter
- Other spectral features

## Requirements

To run the project, you need the following software and libraries:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

You can install the necessary libraries using the following command:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/hovogrig/Stellar-Classification.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd Stellar-Classification
```

3. Install the required libraries if you haven't already:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
To run the project, open the Stellar_Classification.ipynb notebook in Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook Stellar_Classification.ipynb
```
The notebook contains all the steps required to process the data, train the model, and evaluate its performance. Follow the instructions within the notebook to execute each cell.

## Results
The results of the model training and evaluation are documented in the notebook. This includes:

- Data exploration and visualization
- Feature engineering and selection
- Model training and hyperparameter tuning
- Model evaluation metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, etc.)
- Confusion matrix and classification report

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! If you have any ideas, suggestions, or bug reports, please open an issue or submit a pull request. Ensure that your contributions align with the project's objectives and coding standards.
